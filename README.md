# Data-Driven-COVID-19-Predictions-with-Machine-Learning
## COVID-19 Forecasting Models: Linear Regression, SARIMA, Random Forest & SVR

This project implements Linear Regression, SARIMA, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor (SVR) models to forecast daily COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries using historical data. The dataset is preprocessed for missing values, and data is aggregated into weekly and monthly summaries. Predictions are evaluated with accuracy metrics such as MSE, MAE, and R². Users can input a date to generate predictions and visualize the data through multiple types of graphs.

### Features:

1. Multiple Prediction Models: Linear Regression, SARIMA, Random Forest, and SVR to ensure robust and comprehensive forecasting.

2. Data Visualizations: Line, scatter, and bar charts for daily, weekly, and monthly trends of COVID-19 data.

3. Data Aggregation: Summary statistics for weekly and monthly insights into COVID-19 testing, cases, recoveries, and deaths.

4. Performance Evaluation: Accurate evaluation of model performance with MSE, MAE, and R² scores.

### Tasks:

1. Import and preprocess COVID-19 data.
   
2. Perform data analysis and generate visualizations for trends.

3. Aggregate data into weekly and monthly summaries.

4. Calculate per thousand/million stats and the positive rate.

5. Train and evaluate multiple models (Random Forest, SVR, Linear Regression, SARIMA) for prediction.

6. Allow users to input a date for model-based forecasts of cases, deaths, and recoveries.

### How to Use:

1. Run the code with the provided dataset.

2. Enter a date to get predictions for COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries.

3. Visualize the trends using pre-built line, scatter, and bar charts for data analysis.
